# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) in HTML using JavaScript. The bug arises from attempting to remove a node from the DOM immediately after changing its display property. 

## Problem Description

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML page with a div and a button. Clicking the button sets the div's display style to "none" and then attempts to remove it. Because of timing, this sequence usually leads to an error:

`Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'remove' on 'Node': The node to be removed is no longer part of any document.`. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version. The solution involves using a `setTimeout` function to introduce a small delay before removing the element from the DOM, allowing the DOM to update. 

This example highlights the importance of understanding the asynchronous nature of DOM manipulation in JavaScript and the potential need for timing considerations when removing elements.
